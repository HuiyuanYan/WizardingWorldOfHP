Dudley Dursley (b. 23 June 1980) was the Muggle son of Vernon and Petunia Dursley and cousin of Harry Potter. He was obese and insolent as a result of his parents spoiling him throughout his childhood, although he became muscular in his teens. He and his gang often tormented Harry as well as other weaker and younger children in their neighbourhood and at school, taking after the example set by Dudley's parents.

In 1995, he faced Dementors for the first time and was saved by Harry, after which he mellowed and became generally kinder to his cousin. He left 4 Privet Drive in 1997, along with his parents, to be hidden from becoming the next victims of Lord Voldemort and his Death Eaters by the Killing Curse, under the protection of the Order of the Phoenix.

After the Second Wizarding War, he married a woman and had two children. He also remained in contact with Harry, as did his wife and children.
