Crouch was the surname of a pure-blood wizarding family, and one of the Sacred Twenty-Eight. They were related to the Black, Yaxley, Longbottom, Weasley, and other known pure-blood families. According to statements by Albus Dumbledore, the Crouch family was one of the oldest pure-blood families in Great Britain. 

The Crouch family seemed to have a penchant for the Dark Arts, as Bartemius Crouch Junior joined the Death Eaters and his father Bartemius Crouch Senior was quite proficient in using the Imperius Curse against the former. In addition, the Crouch family was a "respectable" pure-blood family, as Charis Black married into this family while Barty Crouch Snr opposed Lord Voldemort.
