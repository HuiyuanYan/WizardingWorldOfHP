Madame Olympe Maxime was a French half-giant witch and was the headmistress of Beauxbatons Academy of Magic. Maxime's preferred mode of transportation was to travel with her students in a powder-blue carriage drawn by twelve winged Abraxan horses, which were bred at Beauxbatons Academy.

Madame Maxime was a half-giantess, although she claimed merely to have "big bones." This was a necessity, however, as the approach to giants (or part-giants) was generally hostile in the wizarding world.
